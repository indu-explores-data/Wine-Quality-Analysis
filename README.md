# üç∑ Wine Quality Analysis ‚Äî Hypothesis Testing

This project explores whether wine quality ratings (4.7, 4.8, and 4.9) differ significantly in terms of chemical properties like **acidity** and **price**. Statistical testing and visual analysis are used to uncover insights that can assist wine certification boards or sommeliers in understanding what affects wine ratings.

---

## üß™ Objectives

- Check normality of `price` and `acidity` across different ratings.
- Use **non-parametric hypothesis testing** to determine if differences are statistically significant.
- Visualize patterns using box plots and correlation matrices.

---

## üìå Key Methods

- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**: Check if data is normally distributed.
- **Kruskal-Wallis Test**: Identify statistically significant differences between rating groups.
- **Box Plots, QQ Plots**: Visual confirmation of distribution patterns.

## üîç Key Insights & Outcomes
- Wines with different ratings show distinct patterns in **price** and **acidity**.
- The distributions are **not normal**, validating the use of **non-parametric tests**.
- **Kruskal-Wallis** tests showed significant differences (p < 0.05) in both variables.
- Higher ratings tend to align with higher or more consistent acidity/price levels.
- Wine ratings are significantly associated with chemical properties, suggesting that quality is influenced by measurable factors.
- Variability in price and acidity indicates that both factors contribute differently to perceived quality.
- Visualizations such as box plots and pairwise plots clearly illustrate differences among rating groups.
- These insights can help sommeliers, wine producers, and certification boards make informed decisions.
